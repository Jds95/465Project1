(Aka Flags)
Protocal's used: SEND_SHIP, SEND_ASTEROIDS 

How to send ships over Server to Client:
Server/Host side: There will be a constant check to see if the client has
openned up a socket to send data through. If so, it immediately sends a flag
to the client, notifying that the next two incoming data segments are x and y
coordinates for a ship. 

How to send ships over Client to Server: 
After client has started up, before checking the received data, it sends a flag
to the server, notifying that the next two incoming data segments are x and y
coordinates for a ship.

This ensures that we establish a proper communication between Server/Client.

How we obtain data for both server and client:
By the use of flags or protocals, we ensure the flow of information from 
Server to client. The client is receiving the terrain and host ship. By using
two seperate protocal tracking, we determine which information is being sent
over to the client. Since the server only has to receive the client ship, 
a single protocal is used to check for incoming data. 

TLDR: Server sends terrain and ship using protocal flags, client receives those
protocals to determine which information is incoming, and sends it's position
of the ship.
